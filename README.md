Objective -  To analyze and derive insights from a dataset of pharmaceutical medicines with a focus on understanding which treatment has most habit forming outcome and combinations of therapeutic, chemical, and action classes to identify the most common and impactful combinations that are associated with habit-forming drugs.
Investigate the medicines that fall under these combinations and their associated substitutes.

Specifically, the combination of Therapeutic Class: NEURO CNS, Chemical Class: Benzodiazepines Derivative, and Action Class: Benzodiazepines stands out as the most significant, with 1,792 medications categorized under it.

Furthermore, the side effects associated with these habit-forming medications are predominantly dizziness and drowsiness, which occur in a majority of cases. Additional side effects include depression and fatigue, making these medications not only habit-forming but also impactful in terms of patient well-being and daily functionality.

This insight underscores the need for cautious prescription practices and patient monitoring, especially when dealing with treatments involving benzodiazepines or similar drug classes
